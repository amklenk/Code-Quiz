# Code-Quiz

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score


1. pseudocode 
2. Decide what goes in HTML and CSS files
3a. Write what is going to be fixed on the page before the JS starts (onclick)
3. create skeleton of variables, functions, event listeners
4. Go through each function, code and debug a line at a time
5. Try every way to break it!
6. Maybe refactor
