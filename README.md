# Code-Quiz

## Description

This project was created to give a timed quiz that stores high scores to a boot camp student so that they can gauge their progress. This is done by fulfilling the following requirements:
* When the start button is clicked, the timer starts and the first question is shown.
* When a question is answered, the next question appears.
* When a question is answered incorrectly, time is subtracted from the timer.
*When all questions are answered or the timer says 0, the game is over. (CHECK THIS ONE)
*When the game is over, the user can save their initials and high score.

## Installation
The repository, Code-Quiz, was created and cloned from GitHub. An index.html file and highscores.html file were created and were coded to contain the site content for the index and highscore pages, respectively. A folder, assets, was created to house two folders, css and js.  The css folder contains the style sheet for the index page, style.css, and the style sheet for the highscore page, hsstyle.css, which were created and coded to contain the site formatting and design for the index and highscore pages, respectively. The js folder contains the script sheet, script.js, which was created and coded to allow the site to be dynamic.
